My name is Lex and I am available for adoption at the RASKC Pet Adoption Center in Kent <p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on April 10, 2017 because they were unable to care for me. I have been around children and done well with them but can be very nervous and uneasy with strangers.<p></p><p></p>The volunteers who take me out every day have let staff know that I have an absolutely stellar personality! I am king, loving, and surprisingly playful at my age!<p></p><p></p>I am a very smart dog!  I have shown my caregivers that I already know &quot;sit,&quot; &quot;down,&quot; and &quot;come.&quot; I am very strong on leash and have a history of pulling hard towards other dogs that I see. For my own safety and the safety of others I will do best with an experienced dog owner that can help me learn more manners on leash.<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs.  I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or need to meet other dogs in the home first.<p></p><p></p>My personality color is GREEN.  I am an adaptable dog who loves to go with the flow!  I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p></p>"

I received the name Amber because of my gorgeous amber colored eyes! You can also find me by my ID #A519499. I am about 9 pounds.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous adopter on April 9, 2017 because I did not get along with the other cat in the home. My previous owner described me as shy but very loving.<p></p><p></p>My previous family loved me very much but felt I was not a good fit for their home. I spent most of my time hiding under the bed while I was with them. Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home with older, respectful children and no other cats. My previous owner said I took a while to warm up and feel confident in my new home, I would do best with someone who has patience for me to warm up!<p></p><p></p>My personality color is BLUE.  I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow.  I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.  Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p></p><p></p>I'd love to meet you! Come meet me today from 1pm to 5:30pm at the Eastside Pet Adoption Center inside the Kirkland Petco, or call (425) 406-8081 to learn more about me!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"
